# Optimised Fitness Functions for runtime improvement , an application on MAGPIE


## Introduction

We are integrating 13 measures and the retry parameter into MAGPIE and performing experiments on 7 benchmarks.
We also performed consistency and correlation to rutnime experiments for the 13 measures + linux time.

Magpie is a tool for automated software improvement.
It implements [MAGPIE](#citation), using the genetic improvement methodology to traverse the search space of different software variants to find improved software.

Magpie provides support for improvement of both functional (automated bug fixing) and non-functional (e.g., execution time) properties of software.  
Two types of language-agnostic source code representations are supported: line-by-line, and XML trees.
For the latter we recommend the [srcML](https://www.srcml.org/) tool with out-of-the-box support for C/C++/C# and Java.  
Finally, Magpie also enables parameter tuning and algorithm configuration, both independently and concurrently of the source code search process.


## Requirements

- Unix (Linux/macOS/etc; untested on Windows)
- Python 3.8+
